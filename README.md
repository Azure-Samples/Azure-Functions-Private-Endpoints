![Build .NET Core](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Azure-Functions-Private-Endpoints/workflows/.NET%20Core/badge.svg)

This sample shows how Azure Functions can connect to other Azure resources via a [private endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview) connection.  The sample uses an [Azure Functions Premium plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-premium-plan) with [regional VNet Integration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-networking-options#regional-virtual-network-integration) to interact with Azure resources confined to a virtual network.

## Prerequisites

The following components are required to run this sample:

- [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
- [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local)
- [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)

### Options

You can use the [Azure Cosmos DB Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator) and [Azure Storage Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-use-emulator), along with the Azure Functions Core Tools, if you wish to develop and test locally.

## Deploy to Azure

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure-Samples%2FAzure-Functions-Private-Endpoints%2Fmaster%2Ftemplate%2Fazuredeploy.json%3Ftoken%3DAAIW4AOWATWNQLL2JZKDBAK63EOOU)

### Deploy to Azure using the Azure CLI

An alternative deployment approach is to use the Azure CLI to deploy the included Resource Manager template.

```azurecli
az group create --name [YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP-NAME] --location [YOUR-DESIRED-AZURE-REGION]

az deployment group create -g [YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP-NAME] --template-file azuredeploy.json --parameters azuredeploy.parameters.json
```

### Deploy the Azure Function code

After the Azure resources are deployed (which can take about 10-12 minutes), you will need to deploy the Azure Function to the newly created Azure Function app. You can use the [Azure Functions Core Tools to deploy the function](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=windows%2Ccsharp%2Cbash#publish).

```azurecli
func azure functionapp publish [YOUR-FUNCTION-APP-NAME]
```

## Running the sample

Please perform the following steps to run the sample.

1. Connect to the newly created VM using Azure Bastion
2. Copy the `sample.csv` file to the newly created VM
3. From the VM, use a web browser to open the Azure portal.
4. Navigate to the newly created storage account which starts with `widgets`.  Using Storage Explorer in the portal, upload the `sample.csv` file to the `orders` blob storage container.
5. Within a few seconds, the function's [blog trigger](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-storage-blob-trigger?tabs=csharp) should execute and process the file.
6. Navigate to newly created CosmosDB resource.  Using Data Explorer in the portal, open the `Widgets` database and `Orders` collection. You should notice the same number of documents in the CosmosDB collection as were in the sample CSV file.

## Key concepts

This sample demonstrates how to configure an Azure Function to work with Azure resources using private endpoints. By using private endpoints, the designated resources are accessible only via the virtual network.

The sample sets up the following Azure resources:

- Azure Function with blob trigger and CosmosDB output binding
- Azure Function Premium plan with Virtual Network (VNet) Integration enabled
- Virtual network
- Configuring private endpoints for Azure resources
  - Azure Storage private endpoints
  - Azure Cosmos DB private endpoint
- Private Azure DNS zones
- Azure VM and Azure Bastion in order to access Azure resources within the virtual network.

### High level architecture

The diagram provide shows a high-level depiction of the sample architecture.

### Storage accounts

Azure Functions [requires the use of a general-purpose storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/storage-considerations#storage-account-requirements).  This sample uses two storage accounts to meet that requirement.

- The storage account referenced by the [AzureWebJobsStorage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-app-settings#azurewebjobsstorage) application setting is configured with a private endpoint.
- The storage account referenced by the [WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-app-settings#website_contentazurefileconnectionstring) does not use a private endpoint.

### Access resources with VNet restrictions

The sample provisions nearly all Azure resources within the confines of a virtual network.  Attempts to access the following resources will only succeed from within the VM (which is itself within the virtual network) due to the virtual network restrictions on the resources:

- Storage accounts
  - `widgets` + unique string (e.g. widgetspmobtiatsqdgc)
  - `fnapp` + unique string + `wjsa` (e.g.fnapppmobtiatsqdgcwjsa)
- CosmosDB
  - `widgets` + unique string (e.g. widgetspmobtiatsqdgc)

There are no virtual network restrictions on the following resources, and thus access to these resources is permitted from outside the virtual network (e.g. your desktop):

- Storage accounts
  - `fnapp` + unique string (e.g. fnapppmobtiatsqdgcac)
  - `vmdiag` + unique string (e.g. vmdiagpmobtiatsqdgc)
